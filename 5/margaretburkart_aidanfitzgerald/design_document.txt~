Project: A terminal-based email client using networking.

User Interface:
     Terminal.

     The user must first set up an account, if he/she does not have one already.

     Then the user must log on to his/her account.

     The various folders (Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Archive, Flagged, etc.)
     can be seen using ls and accessed using cd.

     A "compose" command will open up a text editor in which to write the email.

     The user hits ENTER to send.

     The program will take the first line of the file as the address and the
     second line of the file as the subject. (If we have time, we may include
     cc'ing).

     The program will send the text file to the computer that matches
     the account specified in the address.

     When a user recieves an email, it will appear as a text file in his/her
     inbox and a notification message will be printed on the terminal screen
     regardless of the folder the user is in.
