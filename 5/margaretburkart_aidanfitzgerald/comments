 - Why use shared memory? Sure, it'll persist after the program closes, but it
   will be gone when the computer shuts down.

 - cd cannot be opened by exec. Also, cd won't work the same way it does in
   the shell.

   Suppose your folders are:
    - inbox
    - starred
    - drafts
    - sent
    - archive
    - spam
    - trash

   When you start the program, you are in inbox. Then, to go from inbox to starred,
   you type "cd starred". The shell's cd would attempt to take you to the
   sub-directory inbox/starred. Our version of cd takes you instead to starred.

 - Why not use SMTP?

   - May be too complicated

   - SMTP requires \r\n for line breaks, Linux uses \n. We can't be f***ed to convert
     back and forth between \n and \r\n every time we send and receive email.
