Proposal: "Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe"
    Two players are presented with 9 tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3x3 square. The game starts with one player making a mark
    in any square on any of the nine boards. Then their opponent must make a mark in the board which corresponds to the square of
    the first mark. If a mark is made in the upper lefthand corner of a board, then the subsequent mark must be made on the
    upper lefthand board. The first player to get three boards in a row wins.
