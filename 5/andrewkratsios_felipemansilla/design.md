- Problem:
	- An online version of the daring game "Odds Are".

- Odds Are:
	- A dare game wherein a person issues an outrageous dare to another person, the recipient of the dare must say 1 out of a certain number, demonstrating the likelihood that they will perform the dare. A third party (in this case the computer) counts the other two people down from 3: i.e. 1,2,3. After the countdown, the darer and the daree must say a number through 1 and the certain number (if they said 1-15, it would have to be a number between that). If both participants say the same number, then the daree must perform the dare. -Urban Dictionary
