Avalon

Avalon is a game of deception. 
Basic Gameplay:
The forces of Good are pitted against the forces of Evil. 
The Evil players remain hidden among the Good players.
A single Good player, Merlin, knows who the Evil players are (except Mordred), and must speak in riddles to help his team, and to avoid revealing his identity.
If Merlin is discovered, he can be killed at the end of the game, allowing Evil to win.

Each turn, the "King" of the round votes to bring a certain amount of people on a quest.
The entire party can vote on whether or not to let the quest continue, or can stop it before it even begins.
This provides the players an opportunity to talk to each other and try and deduce who the Evil players are.
If the quest is vetoed, the "King" card is passed to the next player and a new round begins.
If the quest is continued, the players that are on the quest secretly choose to pass or fail the quest. The bad players want to strategically pass/fail the quests to gain trust and deceive the good players.
If the Good team passes 3 quests, they win, but the Evil team can still kill Merlin if they know his identity and win the game.
If the Evil team fails 3 quests, they win right away.
