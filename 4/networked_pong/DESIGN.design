--Description of Project--
Our goal is to create multiplayer pong.  We would start with 2 player pong, but then create a 2-8 player version essentially where instead of having the two sides, we would do a triangle, square, pentagon, etc..
We were also thinking of incorporating a highscores feature that keeps track of highscores (this is a pretty minor feature)
