Proposal: People can play 3 mini-games with each other. The games are tic - tac - toe
	  (2 players), connect 4 (2 players), and connect the dots game (2 <= players <= 4).

Design:
	It will be games played in the terminal played within the same network (for now).
	Users can input a name for themselves (maybe a login if I choose to store stats).
	The users can type in which game they would like and then wait for another player.

Things I'm Using:
       Allocation of memory
       Working with files (if i choose to store stats).
       Processes (server and games)
       Signals
       Pipes (for server)
       Shared Memory
       Networking
Timeline:
	01/07/16 - Write out proposal.
	01/08/16 - Await approval of proposal.
	01/09 - 12/16 - Write up server - client.
	Subsequent Days - Write each game and work on user interface.
