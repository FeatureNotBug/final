DW APPROVED

Name: Sammi Wu Leung

Proposal: 2 players at a time are able to play Connect 4. Others can wait in line.

Design:
	It will be games played in the terminal played within the same network.
	Users will be automatically set up with the other player in the server.

Things I'm Using:
       Allocation of memory
       Working with files
       Processes (server and games)
       Signals
       Pipes (for server)
       Shared Memory

Timeline:
	01/07/16 - Write out proposal.
	01/08/16 - Await approval of proposal.
	01/09 - 20/16 - Write up server - client.
	01/20 - 26/16 - Panic and finish the project in a hackathon style (working for long hours at a time). 

Note: Since I am the sole member, I did not bother pushing on some days.
