# MKS65C Final Project
**_Team Lemon_JEWC - Wayez Chowdhury & Jeremy Elkayam (JEWC) and Alex Sosnovsky (the lemon)_**

## Proposal
- Jeremy: Will you marry me please?
- Wayez: NO!
- Alex: Whoops, apparently that's not the proposal DW wants.

## Actual Proposal
Project Description: This project is essentially a text editor, with the added functionality of multiple people being able to edit the text at once.

Intefrace: The user will interact with the program by viewing (and editing) a text-based document in the terminal. 
- You will be able to traverse through the terminal with that cool little blinky box thing.

Technical Design:
- We will utilize the basic C skills we developed whily taking this class
- This project will require us to use networking. The user will be able to connect to a server and edit a file or files stored on the server. 
- We will also have to build a shell that the user will interact with. This may require us to work with shared memory.
- These files persist even while no one is connected.
- The file auto-saves after a user makes an edit, similar to Google Drive.
- This project will be perfect for programmers working on group project.
- Not sure what algorithms and data structures we will use for this project.
