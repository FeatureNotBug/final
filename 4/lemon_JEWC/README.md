# MKS65C Final Project
**_Team Lemon_JEWC - Wayez Chowdhury & Jeremy Elkayam (JEWC) and Alex Sosnovsky (the lemon)_**

## Proposal
- Jeremy: Will you marry me please?
- Wayez: NO!
- Alex: Whoops, apparently that's not the proposal DW wants.

## Actual Proposal
- This project is essentially a text editor, with the added functionality of multiple people being able to edit the text.
- You will interact with the program by viewing (and typing) a text-based document in the terminal. 
- You will be able to traverse through the terminal with that cool little blinky box thing.
- This uses networking. You will be able to connect to a server and edit a file or files stored on the server. These files persist even while no one is connected.
- The file auto-saves after a user makes an edit, similar to Google Drive.
- This project will be perfect for programmers working on group project.
- Not sure what algorithms and data structures we will use for this project.
