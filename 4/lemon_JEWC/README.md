# MKS65C Final Project
**_Team Lemon JEWC - Wayez Chowdhury & Jeremy Elkayam (the jewc) and Alex Sosnovsky (the lemon)_**

## Proposal
- Will you marry me please?
- Whoops, apparently that's not the proposal DW wants.

## Actual Proposal
- This project is essentially a text editor, with the added functionality of multiple people being able to edit the text.
- You will interact with the program by viewing (and typing) a text-based document in the terminal. You will (probably) be able to traverse through it with that cool little blinky box thing
- This uses networking. You will be able to connect to a server and edit a file or files stored on the server. These files persist even while no one is connected.
