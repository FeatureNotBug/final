=== Description ===

My own version of the Windows Task Manager in the terminal. All system information 
(applications running, PIDs, hardware resource usage) will be aggregated and 
displayed into neatly formatted tables inside different terminal tabs. 
All information will be updated in realtime.

=== Technical Design ===

Redirection and File I/O - Will redirect the output of terminal commands into a text file 
then read them back into a parser for formatting. Also will have the option of saving system 
information to a log file at a specific time stamp.

Signal Handling - Will be able to send various signals to processes of choice.

String/File Parsing - Will take raw data output from a text file and create a table out of it.

=== Timeline ===

1/11/16 - Complete redirection into a file. Figure out whether controlling multiple 
terminal tabs through my program and updating info in real time is doable.

1/15/16 - Complete file parsing and information formatting. All data will be in tables, 
but organization of said tables is unclear (terminal tabs?).

1/18/16 - Everything else. Signals, log file, tabs, realtime updating, and any other features added.
