Names: Emma Bernstein, Jennifer Lee, Mary McGreal

Statement: Mary is looking for a PROM date, so we're going to help her by creating a client-server program to find a compatible date.

Description: Mary's computer will connect to one suitor's computer at a time, but will have the ability to
 disconnect and proceed to connect to a new suitor. Upon starting the program, the user will be prompted for a
  login and password.  Mary (the server) will validate the client logins.  From the interface, users (who would
   like to escort Mary to prom), can message her, and from Mary's end, she can respond. Based on the
    conversation and compatibilty, she can rate them and decide who she wants to go to prom with.  The ratings
	 will be stored in shared memory, which will be controlled by a semaphore.  The shared memory will be shared
	  between the writing process and the analysis process.  The writing process will pull rating data that Mary
	   enters and store it in shared memory.  The analysis process will proceed to analyze the ratings data in
	    shared memory and determine Mary's ideal prom date!


    Topics: 
		*pipes (server and clients)
		*network
		*shared memory/semaphores
		*processes (forking, exec)


Timeline:
	*Design
	*Server and client
	*Store ratings in shared memory
	*Analysis process
	*Implement network, finalize chat
	*Test

Future work: group chat (Mary (server) will be able to receive messages from more than one client at a time)
