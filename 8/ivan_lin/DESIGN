DW NOTE: I Need more information, how exactly will you be making file operations easier?

Group Members: Ivan Lin

Description of Project:
This will be a tool to assist in file management. It will make complex file and directory operations much simpler on users who do not wish to learn or remember regex expressions or look up certain flags. It will be able to map out directory trees and allow for better user organization.

Instead of writing out a pattern, there will be questions, user prompts, and input fields users can answer to find specific files. There will be options to create folders and automatically move and organize files. Options will include: sorting, renaming, deleting, and creating files and directories.

The interface will be a form.

Expansion Plans:
Possibly a GUI version

Lessons Used:
file and directory control
program execution
string formatting


Timeline:
1/6/16: Initial proposal submitted
