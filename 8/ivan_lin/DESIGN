DW NOTE: I Need more information, how exactly will you be making file operations easier?

Group Members: Ivan Lin

Description of Project:
This will be a tool to assist in file management. It will make complex file and directory operations much simpler on users who do not wish to learn or remember regex expressions or look up certain flags. It will be able to map out directory trees and allow for better user organization.

The project will have a user friendly interface to allow users to search for patterns in files and rename or manipulate them. There will be user prompts and simpler ways to sort, rename, delete, and create files to make things easier for users.

Expansion Plans:
Possibly a GUI version

Lessons Used:
file and directory control
program execution
string formatting

Timeline:
1/6/16: Initial proposal submitted
