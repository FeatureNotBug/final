#Directory Typer (Prototype)

#Description
As of present, this project lets you create a list of a directory tree. Any changes made through the editor will be replicated with the actual files, so all renaming can be done in one place.

#Usage
Just run make run to start editing your current directory!
If you would like to use a different directory, run<br>
-$./dirinfo <directory name><br>
-$./editor<br>
separately

#Unfinished
Due to time constraints, only renaming files is allowed. Renaming directories, deleting, and creating new files and directories is a work in progress

#Bugs
-Segfaults when one scrolls too quickly
-Problems with small screen sizes
