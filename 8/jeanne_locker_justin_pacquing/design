Project Mates: Jeanne Locker & Justin Pacquing - Pd.8

Project Proposal: Battleship Bash Bros. (BBB)

Description: A program that enables players on different machines to play each other in a game of Battleship!
Two players join the game, set up their fleet of 5 ship on a 5x5 board, and take turns guessing their opponent's ship's locations.

Technicals of How It'll Work:
- One user will run a program to set-up the game and options, waiting on another user to run the program that will connect the two into the game.
- Both users will then be prompted to set coordinates of their ships, only moving on to the actual game when both are ready.
- Turns work by the user being prompted to select a coordinate of the opponents to attack
- Using scanf, user input will determine where the attack will take place.
- The user will be notified of the success of their move and boards of both the users and opponents will be displayed after every turn.
- When one player has completely wiped the board of his opponent's ships, they will be declared the winner and the game ends.

Concepts/Ideas Used:
- Reading/Writing to Files
- Shared Memory/Semaphores
- Signals
- Piping
- Networking

Timeline:
- Set up pipes - 1/10
- Organize internal stuff (boards, storing of guesses/locations of ships, etc) - 1/14
- Print your and opponent's boards (to see your ships location/where you've guessed) - 1/25
- Semaphore-ing 1/22
