Project Proposal: Battleship Bash Bros. (BBB)

Description: A program that enables players on different machines to play each other in a game of Battleship, but with a few twists!
Ay, Captain, users can opt for a standard game of Battleship (Users place their ships on a grid, take turns trying to sink their opponents ships,
until no ships on one user's board remains) but can also enable two different modes:
- Rush, where users must make a move in a certain amount of time or have their turns forfeited and a ship damaged or even sunk
- Flux, where users can sacrifice a turn to attack the opponent in order to reposition one of their ships

Technicals of How It'll Work:
- One user will run a program to set-up the game and options, waiting on another user to run the program that will connect the two into the game.
- Both users will then be prompted to set coordinates of their ships, only moving on to the actual game when both are ready.
- Turns work by the user being prompted to select a coordinate of the opponents to attack (or change a ship's cooridnates in Flux mode)
- The user will be notified of the success of their move and boards of both the users and opponents will be displayed after every turn.
- When one player has completely wiped the board of his opponent's ships, they will be declared the winner and the game ends.
