JAN 5
- exec'd twice, creating two new tabs in Chromium browser rather than one
	- FIXED Jan 6

JAN 10
- accidentally made it so new bid wipes out old bid =___=
- shmid error 22: invalid argument in control.c
	- sort of fixed but still wipes out old bid
		- FIXED, but...
- tried to use global variables to access current lot being edited (to change new low bid price).  
	- uses global variable but hangs on This is entered bid: 
	- does write to bids file.
	- invalid pointer error.
	- changed it back so linker error
	- fixed linker error but now invalid pointer error
	- fixed (was a wrong "free()") but now nothing happens...doesn't allow bid at all

JAN 11
- turns out there were some malloc'ing issues that were complicated, ended up not making global vars
- now updates, "allows" bids as it should BUT still need to make lot value update.
	- FIXED and does update lot value now, not that this actually matters, the way I have written this program...
		- JAN 12: but no longer writes value into file??  Did I do that on purpose?
	- I will need a way to free those pointers once I'm done....not sure how to do this yet.

JAN 13:
- now tried to server-ify it, but need to find a way to handle invalid bids.
- Okay, now it sort of takes care of that.  Using ?/y/n method to check which action to perform; it's not good so far...
- I should really figure out how to free the Lot pointer...
- tried to make it so that ?/y/n request for input in while loop, but now the server is not printing out updates in bids.
- shared memory torture is now a waste because I'm not making good use of it anymore.

JAN 15
- realized new version in progress ("Reconstructed") hangs after asking whether you want to view the work.  Probably forgot to clean up those last few parts
	- FIXED a couple minutes later...
- need to make Bid do something LOOL (it's in the wrong loop...)

more bugs
doesn't run yet lololol

Possible changes to make?
	- browser defaults to Chromium, add Firefox option later?
