JAN 5
- exec'd twice, creating two new tabs in Chromium browser rather than one
	- FIXED Jan 6

JAN 10
- accidentally made it so new bid wipes out old bid =___=
- shmid error 22: invalid argument in control.c
	- sort of fixed but still wipes out old bid
		- FIXED, but...
- tried to use extern to access current lot being edited (to change new low bid price).  Errors abound.

more bugs
doesn't run yet lololol

Possible changes to make?
	- browser defaults to Chromium, add Firefox option later?
