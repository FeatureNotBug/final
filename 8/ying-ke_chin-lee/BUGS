JAN 5
- exec'd twice, creating two new tabs in Chromium browser rather than one
	- FIXED Jan 6

JAN 10
- accidentally made it so new bid wipes out old bid =___=
- shmid error 22: invalid argument in control.c
	- sort of fixed but still wipes out old bid
		- FIXED, but...
- tried to use global variables to access current lot being edited (to change new low bid price).  
	- uses global variable but hangs on This is entered bid: 
	- does write to bids file.
	- invalid pointer error.
	- changed it back so linker error
	- fixed linker error but now invalid pointer error
	- fixed (was a wrong "free()") but now nothing happens...doesn't allow bid at all

JAN 11
- turns out there were some malloc'ing issues that were complicated, ended up not making global vars
- now updates, "allows" bids as it should BUT still need to make lot value update.

more bugs
doesn't run yet lololol

Possible changes to make?
	- browser defaults to Chromium, add Firefox option later?
