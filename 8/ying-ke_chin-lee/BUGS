JAN 5
- exec'd twice, creating two new tabs in Chromium browser rather than one
	- [FIXED] Jan 6

JAN 13:
- now tried to server-ify it, but need to find a way to handle invalid bids.
- Okay, now it sort of takes care of that.  Using ?/y/n method to check which action to perform; it's not good so far...
- tried to make it so that ?/y/n request for input in while loop, but now the server is not printing out updates in bids.

JAN 15:
- realized new version in progress ("Reconstructed") hangs after asking whether you want to view the work.  Probably forgot to clean up those last few parts
	- [FIXED] a couple minutes later...
- need to make Bid do something LOOL (it's in the wrong loop...)
- don't try to give negative input yet.  It's not ready to deal with silly input
	- [FIXED] Now it will be an unsuccessful bid.  As it should be.  (by JAN 24)

JAN 16:
- [FIXED] fgets hang (was a typo left over from reorganizing the code)
- need to figure out why client code suddenly decides to quit on its own.
	- [FIXED] (by JAN 24), believed to be updating num_bidders in the wrong process (child, rather than parent)

JAN 21:
- [FIXED] issues with receiving new bid, now updates bids appropriately
- still need to make use of paddle numbers 
	- [UPDATE] JAN 22 may need to use something rather than pid for paddle numbers

JAN 22:
- [FIXED] issue where exit(0) was placed in old_main rather than in client_socket so the program quit too quickly without informing server.
- server/client out of sync, cause unknown.
	- [UPDATE] JAN 22 seems that it is back in sync, though client oddly receives messages from server twice.
	- [UPDATE] JAN 22 no longer gives messages to client twice, but Server does fail to react to client requests
	- [FIXED] JAN 24 I believe it was an extra write floating around...
- server does not return newly found bid price to client.
	- [FIXED] JAN 22 server returns price to client.

JAN 24:
- No known bugs at this time
- probably more prints that are ugly than I need, though...

Possible changes to make?
	- browser defaults to Chromium, add Firefox option later?
	- put in login
