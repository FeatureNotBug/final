JAN 5
- exec'd twice, creating two new tabs in Chromium browser rather than one
	- [FIXED] Jan 6

JAN 10
- accidentally made it so new bid wipes out old bid =___=
- shmid error 22: invalid argument in control.c
	- sort of fixed but still wipes out old bid
		- [FIXED], but...
- tried to use global variables to access current lot being edited (to change new low bid price).  
	- uses global variable but hangs on This is entered bid: 
	- does write to bids file.
	- invalid pointer error.
	- changed it back so linker error
	- [FIXED] linker error but now invalid pointer error
	- [FIXED] (was a wrong "free()") but now nothing happens...doesn't allow bid at all

JAN 11
- turns out there were some malloc'ing issues that were complicated, ended up not making global vars
- now updates, "allows" bids as it should BUT still need to make lot value update.
	- [FIXED] and does update lot value now, not that this actually matters, the way I have written this program...
		- JAN 12: but no longer writes value into file??  Did I do that on purpose?
	- I will need a way to free those pointers once I'm done....not sure how to do this yet.

JAN 13:
- now tried to server-ify it, but need to find a way to handle invalid bids.
- Okay, now it sort of takes care of that.  Using ?/y/n method to check which action to perform; it's not good so far...
- tried to make it so that ?/y/n request for input in while loop, but now the server is not printing out updates in bids.
- shared memory torture is now a waste because I'm not making good use of it anymore.

JAN 15:
- realized new version in progress ("Reconstructed") hangs after asking whether you want to view the work.  Probably forgot to clean up those last few parts
	- [FIXED] a couple minutes later...
- need to make Bid do something LOOL (it's in the wrong loop...)
- don't try to give negative input yet x___x it's not ready to deal with silly input

JAN 16:
- [FIXED] fgets hang (was a typo left over from reorganizing the code)
- need to figure out why client code suddenly decides to quit on its own.

JAN 21:
- [FIXED] issues with receiving new bid, now updates bids appropriately
- still need to make use of paddle numbers 
	- [UPDATE] JAN 22 may need to use something rather than pid for paddle numbers
- need to check whether client code will suddenly quit on its own
- need to make display update with new bidding price

JAN 22:
- [FIXED] issue where exit(0) was placed in old_main rather than in client_socket so the program quit too quickly without informing server.
- server/client out of sync, cause unknown.
	- [UPDATE] JAN 22 seems that it is back in sync, though client oddly receives messages from server twice.
	- [UPDATE] JAN 22 no longer gives messages to client twice, but Server does fail to react to client requests
- server does not return newly found bid price to client.
	- [UPDATE] JAN 22 server returns price to client.

Possible changes to make?
	- browser defaults to Chromium, add Firefox option later?
	- put in login
