Period 8


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
We aim to recreate the card game Uno, mainly working in the terminal. There can be as many players as desired. The objective of the game is to discard all your cards by playing them. 
Some simple rules:
   1. If the previous card is a number card, your card may either be the same color or value. You may also choose to draw a card.
   2. If the previous card is an action card (ie Draw 2, Wild Card)
