Everything in board.c is susceptible to buffer overflow and may cause severe eyesores due to poor (total lack of) readability. This should probably be changed.

There is no error checking on where the ship peices are put down. Putting down a peice where it should not be put down may cause problems. Please avoid causing problems.

Similarly, making guesses that are out of bounds may cause problems (e.g. putting down "Z1" as a guess when it is only a 5 by 5 board).

When there are more than two players in a game, and at least two of the players have the same name, there can be unpredictable behavior.

There is not a lot of commenting in the code itself. Trying to understand this code is like trying to understand quantum electrodynamics - not for the faint of heart.
