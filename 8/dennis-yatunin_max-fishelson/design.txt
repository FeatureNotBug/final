You can't C my battleship!

By Dionysus Yatunin and Maximus Fishelson

You - Battleship?! But that's so unoriginal!
Us  - Ah, but have you ever played Battleship with 10 other people, all on different computers?
You - Woah... Dude, that's sick! Wait but does it have single player mode for when I'm feeling lonely?
Us  - You bet it has single player mode! And it has options for changing the size of the board!
You - Oh, boy! I bet it has really neat graphics as well, right?
Us  - Well, um... Hey, look at that dodo behind you!
You - What? A dodo? Where?
Us  - *crickets*

Sirius Things:
Sirius has a visual apparent magnitude of âˆ’1.46, making it the brightest star in the Earth's night sky.
It is slowly moving closer to the Solar System, so its brightness will continue to increase over the next 60,000 years.
It is actually a binary star system, with the main Sirius A joined by its faint white dwarf companion, called Sirius B.
Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun and has an absolute visual magnitude of 1.42.

Serious Things:
This project will make use of networking, interprocess communication, and string manipulation (and maybe file i/o for record-keeping).
Users will play our game through the terminal, with a text-based interface that displays maps and allows commands to be entered.
There might be several options for board size and ship count, or users might set those themselves.
A user will be able to either play against the computer or choose to start a multiplayer game, to which others may then connect.
Turns might be limited in terms of time (useful in multiplayer games so everyone else doesn't have to wait for a slow player).
